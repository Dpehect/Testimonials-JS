              " Sultan Mahmut II, also known as Mahmut the Reformer, was the Ottoman Sultan from 1808 to 1839. He was the son of Sultan Abdulhamid I and was born in Istanbul in 1785. Mahmut II was known for his efforts to modernize and reform the Ottoman Empire, which was facing significant challenges and internal unrest at the time. He implemented a series of reforms known as the Tanzimat, which aimed to improve the legal system, modernize the economy, and centralize the government. Some of the key reforms introduced by Mahmut II included the abolition of the Janissaries, a military corps that had become a powerful and destabilizing force within the empire, and the establishment of a new army and bureaucracy. Mahmut II also sought to improve relations with European powers and worked to modernize the Ottoman economy by encouraging foreign investment and trade. He died in 1839 and was succeeded by his son, Abdulmejid I. "
